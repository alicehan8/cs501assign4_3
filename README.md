## Assignment 4.3 Temperature Dashboard – Simulated Sensor Data with StateFlow and Coroutines
This app is a temperature dashboard that displays simulated temperature updates. 
This includes a list of temperature readings alongside their timestamps, statistics such as current, average, minimum, and maximum temperatures, and a simple graph that shows the temperature change over time. 
Using coroutines to simulate regular temperature readings and StateFlow to continuously update the data, the UI is updated with real-time updates of the new data. 

**Running the app:** Clone this repo in Android Studio and run an emulator
